inline css - writing the code inside the HTML element AND DONT FCNKG USE it
internal css - writing the code inside the head element of HTML

<style>
      h1 {
        color: blue;             seperation of concerns
      }
    </style>

external css - creating a seperate file

for id elements - use #

main difference between IDs and classes is that we can not repeat ID names

convence is to use dashes for css double names

for class - use .

in real world we use classes, not IDs

RGBA - where 'a' is alpha and stands for transparency
