CSS - cascading style sheets

h1, h2, p - are selctors for CSS
color, text-allign... - properties
blue, 20px... - value
all together - is a declaration block


inline css - writing the code inside the HTML element AND DONT FCNKG USE it
internal css - writing the code inside the head element of HTML

<style>
      h1 {
        color: blue;             seperation of concerns
      }
    </style>

external css - creating a seperate file

for id elements - use #

main difference between IDs and classes is that we can not repeat ID names

convence is to use dashes for css double names

for class - use .

in real world we use classes, not IDs

RGBA - where 'a' is alpha and stands for transparency

shorthand property - to define different values for different properties

usding :first-child for a first element in the list (for example)

odd - нечетный

nth-child (nothing) - you can then select it by 1,2...also can use odd or even (четный, нечетный)

a:link - where link specifies anchors with href attribute

text-decoration - no underlines for example (where is the line, line stile, line color)

a:active - pseudoclass when you press the mouse button
